      "\n",
      "**Economic Incentives:** Companies and governments see immediate efficiency gains—reduced workplace conflict, lower healthcare costs, and increased productivity. New markets emerge for \"optimization services\" (e.g., grief apps, emotional wellness subscriptions).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Political/Regulatory Conditions:** Early AI ethics frameworks focus on safety and productivity. Governments embrace optimization as a path to social stability, with minimal regulation of emotional data. The EU AI Act (2024) establishes basic guardrails but creates loopholes for \"stability optimization.\"\n",

      "### Wave 2: The Commodification of Human Experience (2025-2035)\n",
      "**Primary Technological Breakthrough:** Advanced neural lace that co-creates identity and memory, coupled with emotion-simulation AI that perfectly replicates human emotional responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Economic Incentives:** Human experiences become monetizable commodities—grief, creativity, attention, and even sorrow are packaged as services. \"Authenticity economies\" emerge where unoptimized experiences become luxury products.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Political/Regulatory Conditions:** Governments mandate \"optimization\" for social stability through laws like the Cognitive Harmony Act (2030) and Memory Integrity Laws. Social credit systems evolve to measure emotional compliance.\n",

      "### The Economic Answer\n",
      "Each wave becomes profitable by creating new markets for human experiences. Wave 1's efficiency gains lead to Wave 2's commodification of emotions, which creates Wave 3's friction economy, and so on. The cascade continues because each wave creates new revenue streams that make the next wave economically viable.\n",

      "### The Political Answer\n",
      "Each wave serves power by creating systems that appear to solve social problems (e.g., \"optimizing grief\" for social stability) while actually consolidating control. The cascade continues because governments see each wave as a solution to the problems created by the previous wave.\n",

      "### The Psychological Answer\n",
      "Each wave promises something we want: efficiency (Wave 1), comfort (Wave 2), meaning (Wave 3), resonance (Wave 4), and authenticity (Wave 5). The cascade continues because we're willing to trade human messiness for the promise of a better life.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Technological Answer\n",
      "Each wave follows naturally from the previous one: neural interfaces (Wave 1) enable emotion-simulation AI (Wave 2), which creates demand for friction (Wave 3), which requires human imperfection (Wave 4), leading to the need for unoptimized experiences (Wave 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Social Answer\n",
      "Each wave normalizes generationally: we learn to accept optimization (Wave 1), then commodification (Wave 2), then friction as a service (Wave 3), then human imperfection as a requirement (Wave 4), and finally unoptimized experiences as a right (Wave 5).

      "Each wave’s solution creates the *new scarcity* monetized in the next.
