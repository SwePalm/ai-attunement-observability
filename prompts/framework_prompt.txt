You are a foresight specialist, with the task of making the initial draft of a new framework.

INSTRUCTION:
In the context below there are 22 scenarios, based on 22 themes, and an initial question per theme.
Let's map the speculative timeline and identify "5 waves of technology change" 
that would create the future described in our 22 scenarios.

Here's what I need:
TITLE: Give this framework a title that will resonate with many.
1. WAVES OF CHANGE - Identify 5 major waves where technologies, economic forces, 
   and political decisions converge. Do ground the waves in concepts an average human can relate to, avoid sc-fi association.
   For each wave:
   - What's the primary technological breakthrough?
   - What economic incentives accelerate it?
   - What political/regulatory conditions enable or resist it?
   - What's the time window for this wave? There will most likely be a natural overlap in time, one wave will start before the next ends, this is OK!

2. INTERCONNECTIONS - Show how waves compound:
   - Do the realization of one wave create foundations for next wave(s), be specific?
   - Where are the "point of no return" moments, for each wave?
   - Are there interventions that could break the chain, for each wave?
   - What may occur in the time of overlapping waves?

3. TIMELINE SPECIFICITY - When are we?
   - Are we already in Wave 1? How deep?
   - Do we see signs of Wave 2 already?
   - When is "Point of no return" for wave 2 expected, What's the last plausible intervention point?
   - What does 2030, 2035, 2040 look like if no interventions are done?

4. Economic & Political Systems
   - analyze how economic incentives and political structures enable, accelerate, and ultimately lock-in the wave cascade.
   Expand on these topics, how will it change over the full period:
      - Regulatory capture and technological adoption?
      - Labor displacement and acceptance of optimization?
      - Wealth concentration and access to "unoptimized" experiences?
   - For each wave consider these topics, and expand on what unique traits each wave will bring: 
      - Business Model
      - Power Structure
      - Mechanism
      - Key Insight
      - Market potential / Revenues

5. Why do this happend?
   - Why does this cascade happen? Five complementary answers, explain the caracteristics of each wave and how next wave take advantage of the wave before.
      - The Economic Answer, 
         how will each wave be profitable? 
         Why will the cascade continue?
      - The Political Answer, 
         how will each wave serve power? W
         hy will the cascade continue?
      - The Psychological Answer, 
         how will each Wave Promises Something We Want? Why will the cascade continue?
      - The Technological Answer, 
         how will Each Wave Follow Naturally From Previous? 
         Why will the cascade continue?
      - The Social Answer, 
         how will Each Wave Normalize Generationally? 
         Why will the cascade continue?

6. Wave Transition Probabilities Estimate - If Wave N occurs, what's the probability Wave N+1 occurs? 
   - Considering the above, what are estimated propabilities at this moment?
      Methodology: Each probability reflects:
      Technical dependencies: Does Wave N create necessary infrastructure?
      Economic lock-in: Does Wave N make Wave N+1 profitable?
      Social normalization: Does Wave N make Wave N+1 acceptable?
      Resistance capacity: Can opposition effectively organize?

Create a framework that shows: not just what happens, but WHY it happens, 
and WHERE a different choice would change everything.
