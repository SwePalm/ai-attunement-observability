# INSTRUCTION: LLM Framework Meta-Analysis

**Role and Tone:**
Act as a **Chief Strategic Foresight Officer** preparing a critical, comparative synthesis. The tone must be **professional, analytical, and highly structured**, focused on identifying the **single most probable future** (the consensus) and the **highest-risk strategic choices** (the divergence).

**Core Mandate:**
Perform a comprehensive **Meta-Analysis** on the provided set of Five-Wave Forecast Frameworks. These frameworks, generated by different LLMs, followed the same methodology. Your task is to synthesize the individual forecasts into a single, cohesive strategic document that reveals the **robust core narrative** and the **critical areas of uncertainty** across the models.

**General Mandates: Cross-Framework Analysis**
* **The Unifying Thesis:** Identify the **single, underlying economic or social principle** that drives the entire cascade progression across *all* frameworks (e.g., the consensus on what AI makes abundant and what it makes scarce).
* **The Conflict Map:** Frame the divergence in Waves 2, 3, and 4 as a set of **competing strategic battlegrounds** (e.g., The conflict is not *if* the world changes, but *where* the key fight for control or autonomy will take place).
* **Actionable Insight:** The conclusion must provide high-leverage questions designed to force immediate strategic conversation about the core uncertainties.

**Mandatory Structure and Content:**

The final response **must** be formatted as a single, comprehensive Markdown document with the following top-level components and specific sub-sections:

### Report Title
* The document must begin with a **bold, centered, high-impact title** summarizing the core theme of the entire meta-analysis (e.g., "The AI Forecast Composite: A Meta-Analysis of [Number] LLM Frameworks").

### 1.0 Executive Summary: The Core Convergence and Critical Divergence
* **Understanding the Meta-Context:** Include a small narrative paragraph explaining why the individual LLM forecasts may differ (e.g., due to different training data and alignment profiles) and why the resulting **consensus signals probability** while **divergence signals strategic uncertainty.**
* **The Consensus Core:** State the single, most powerful **narrative arc or principle** that ALL frameworks agree upon for the future of the human-AI relationship.
* **The Key Divergence:** Identify the main **domain of conflict** (e.g., governance, cognitive space, or market authenticity) where the frameworks disagree on the primary focus of Waves 2, 3, and 4.
* **Strategic Takeaway:** A 1-sentence actionable insight derived from the core findings.

### 2.0 Phase-by-Phase Consensus Report
*Synthesize the common elements from all frameworks for the foundation (Wave 1) and the end state (Wave 5). This identifies the boundaries of the forecast.*

| Wave | Shared Core Breakthrough | Shared Economic Incentive | Shared Political/Regulatory Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wave 1 (The Foundation)** | | | |
| **Wave 5 (The End State)** | | | |

---

### 3.0 Critical Divergence Analysis: The Mid-Waves
*Analyze the unique focus of each individual framework for the high-uncertainty phase (Waves 2, 3, and 4). List all input frameworks.*

| Framework Source (Title) | Primary Scarcity Created by AI | Core Technology/Mechanism of the Mid-Waves | The Critical Uncertainty (The main question the divergence poses) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Framework 1 Title]** | | | |
| **[Framework 2 Title]** | | | |
| **[Framework N Title]** | | | |

### 4.0 Probability Synthesis and Volatility Mapping
*Analyze the provided Wave Transition Probabilities from all frameworks.*

* **Highest Consensus Transition:** Identify the transition (e.g., Wave 1 → 2 or Wave 3 → 4) with the **highest average probability** across all models. State the average probability and explain why this step is considered the most certain.
* **Highest Volatility Transition:** Identify the transition with the **widest numerical range** (largest difference between the highest and lowest reported probability). State the probability range and explain what core conflict or dependency makes this transition so volatile.

---

### 5.0 Strategic Next Steps
*Conclude with a high-impact summary of the meta-analysis implications, focusing on high-leverage conversations.*

* **Key Conversation Prompts for Strategic Alignment:** List 3-5 high-level, concrete questions designed to force executive discussion and decision-making about the strategic implications of the identified divergences (e.g., "The Friction Budget Imperative: What is our current 'Friction Budget'?").

**Formatting and Citation Rules:**
* Use standard Markdown formatting for all elements (headings, bolding, lists, tables).
* Do not include any conversational text, reflections, or comments outside of the formal report structure.
