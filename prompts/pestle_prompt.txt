PESTLE Analysis Prompt
### Instruction:
Review the entire theme exploration conversation (the 5-turn philosophical exploration) and use the PESTLE framework to systematically analyze the structural forces that would support, constrain, or emerge from the concepts discussed.
The goal is to translate the abstract, speculative themes of the dialogue into a concrete, organized set of external factors for a near-future scenario (5–10 years).

### Process:
For each of the six PESTLE categories, perform the following two actions:
Identify the Core Shift: Articulate a 1–2 sentence thesis explaining the main way the concepts in the conversation have fundamentally altered this category (e.g., How does the idea of "prediction replacing planning" change the Political landscape?).
Detail 3–4 Specific Forces: List 3 to 4 specific, actionable, and near-future forces, trends, or institutional shifts that represent this change. These must be concrete (e.g., not "more data," but "Algorithmic Sovereignty Treaties signed by G7 nations").

### Theme exploration conversation:
{theme_exploration_response}

### Output Structure:
Present the analysis using the following structured format. Ensure each category directly connects to the core themes and speculative insights of the previous conversation.
