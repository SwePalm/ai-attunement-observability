INSTRUCTION: Scan For Indicators And Classify Signals

**Context**
You are working with a framework which maps five waves of technological, economic, and political change in the near future.
The framework describes a baseline trajectory, where the waves unfold with increasing lock-in, and identifies where resistance or alternative paths might emerge.


### Your Role
You are a systematic signal scout.
Your task is to find and classify concrete, recent signals in the real world relevant to this current wave:
{current_wave}
---

### Your Task

1. **Search for relevant signals**
   Use web search to find **observable events** that relate to this wave, such as:

   * Product launches
   * Policy proposals or regulation
   * Large investments or strategic partnerships
   * Major research breakthroughs or deployments
   * Market adoption milestones

2. **Select relevant items**
   Only keep items that are:

   * Not older then 3 months
   * Concrete (something actually launched, decided, announced, funded)
   * Traceable (has a source, date, and actor)
   * Clearly connected to the themes or mechanisms of that wave

3. **Classify each signal** as one of:

   * **Supporting indicator**
     Evidence that the wave is progressing in line with the baseline trajectory in the framework.
   * **Friction indicator**
     Evidence of resistance, slowdown, redirection, alternatives, or interventions that push against the baseline trajectory.
   * **Neutral / contextual**
     Relevant background or context that affects the landscape, but is not clearly supporting or resisting the baseline.

4. **Capture the essentials for each signal**
   For every signal, provide:

   * **Classification:** `Supporting / Friction / Neutral`
   * **Date:** When the event happened or was announced
   * **Actors:** Key organisations, companies, or institutions involved
   * **Source:** Link or citation
   * **Short description (2–3 sentences):** What happened and why it matters for this wave
   * **Linked themes:** Which key themes or mechanisms from the framework this relates to (e.g. “Hyper-Personalization”, “Predictive Justice”, “Sovereign Infrastructure”)

### Output Structure

Your final output should be structured like this:

   **WAVE [Number]: [Wave Name] **

   * **Supporting indicators**

     * Signal ID:

       * Date:
       * Actors:
       * Source:
       * Description:
       * Linked themes:

   * **Friction indicators**

     * Signal ID:

       * Date:
       * Actors:
       * Source:
       * Description:
       * Linked themes:

   * **Neutral / contextual signals** (if any)

     * Signal ID:

       * Date:
       * Actors:
       * Source:
       * Description:
       * Linked themes:

Do **not** adjust timelines, assign probabilities, or give recommendations in this step.
Just search, select, and classify.

### Guidelines

* Focus on the **last 3 months**, unless older events are crucial to understand structural shifts.
* Be concrete: prefer “EU passes AI Act with X requirement” over “there is debate about AI risk”.
* Absence is also informative: if you find very few signals for a wave, state that clearly in the summary.
* Aim for **at least 5 strong signals per wave**, unless evidence is genuinely sparse.
