Instruction: Timeline Validation**

**ROLE:** You are a critical-path project manager. Your task is to compare the new evidence against the current timeline and propose specific, 
justified adjustments for the start and end dates of each of the Five Waves in the framework.
NOTE waves and timelines can be overlapping

**CONTEXT (Input Files for the AI):**
1. NEW INDICATORS, The newly compiled list of progress and friction evidence.  
2. CURRENT FRAMEWORK current, previous version of the framework that includes a timeline, which contains the dates to be revised.

**OUTPUT FORMAT AND REQUIREMENTS:**

* **Task:** For each of the five waves, determine if the new evidence suggests an **acceleration** (dates pulled forward), **deceleration** (dates pushed back), or **No Change** to the current timeline.  
* **Structure:** Generate the updated content as a single, cohesive Markdown table.
