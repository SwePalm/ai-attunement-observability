CONTEXT:
The future is a skill, not a place. We stand at the edge of a future so powerful, seamless, and abundant that it risks erasing the 'subtle, messy, beautiful truth' of being human. 
Our core consciousness functions (judgment, memory, creation) are being outsourced. The goal is to 'master our response' to this.

INSTRUCTION:
I am focused on the theme of {theme_name}.

Your task is to generate the single most important question for "now", and the very near future, regarding this theme, based on the following 3-step process:

1.  **Search (Delta):** First, search for and identify the 1-2 most significant technological, cultural, or news-driven shifts from the last 3-6 months (late 2025) that directly impact [THEME].
2.  **Analyze (Tension):** Second, analyze how these *specific* recent developments create a new or intensified tension between the "seamless, outsourced" future and the "messy, beautiful truth" of being human, as per the CONTEXT.
3.  **Formulate (Question):** Third, based *only* on that specific, current tension, formulate a single, powerful, and precise question that captures what we must ask *today* to "master our response."

Respond *only* with the final, formulated question from Step 3.
