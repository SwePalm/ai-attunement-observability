INSTRUCTION: Update framework after validation.

After the initial draft generation of attached framework we have done some validation, and I want you to consolidate this new information into the final version of the framework.
We only want one document to share, so no references to any other sources.

Do not remove any context from the draft, but check timelines in the full document and Probabilities in section 6.

EXISTING FRAMEWORK:
{draft_framework}

NEW TINELINE:
{timeline_table}

NEW TIMELINE SPECIFICITY:
{specifics}

Respond with the full updated framework, as a final version, formatted as a markdown document.
